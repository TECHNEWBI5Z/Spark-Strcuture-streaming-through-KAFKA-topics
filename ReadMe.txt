Project Title: Real-Time Data Processing with Kafka and Spark Structured Streaming

Overview

This project focuses on building a robust real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Structured Streaming. The primary goal is to ingest, process, and analyze streaming data to derive actionable insights in real-time.

Objectives
1. Data Ingestion: Utilize Kafka for ingesting streaming data from various sources.
2. Real-Time Processing: Implement Spark Structured Streaming to process and transform the data in real-time.
3. Storing kafkaesque reads in Kafka topics.
4. Adapt 2 Tier Medallion architecture
